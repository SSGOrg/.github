## Welcome to the SSG Open Source Collaboration. üëã  
We are a team of developers from all of the world who are working at bringing professional grade open source security tools and frameworks to the masses. 
This said, this a community git organization. Meaning anyone can offer up project ideas and contribute to the team. At the end of the day we aim to help people learn coding through doing. Thus supporting the "Hands on imperitive" aspect of hacker ethics.
