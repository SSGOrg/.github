Welcome to Saints Security Group LLC's open source initiative! We are excited to share our knowledge, tools, and expertise with the community to contribute to a safer digital world.

# ‚ÑπÔ∏è About Us
Starting out in 2021 as a group of friends with a collective interest and passion for cyber security. We took that passion and double down on it. Forming the worlds first society for security research. Known then as the Societal Security Guild or SSG for short. We knew SSG had the potential to be so much more. 

In June of 2023 we made the move to turn SSG from a society into an LLC. Having a few projects under our belts and backed by the community we had built the only place we could imagine going was forward.
